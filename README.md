Puzzles
=======

This repository is purely a collection of puzzles/challenges meant to get my brain warmed up in the mornings. There are 

multiple sites that host such problems. It seems like a neat brain teaser and a way to slowly expand my experience. I am 

currently working my way through CodeEval challenges.

* CodeEval: 9 Challenges
* Project Euler
* CodeBat
* TopCoder
